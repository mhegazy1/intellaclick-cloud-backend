# Fix for InstructorId "[object Object]" Issue

## Problem Description

Classes in the database have their `instructorId` field stored as the string "[object Object]" instead of a proper MongoDB ObjectId. This causes:

1. Instructors cannot see or manage their classes
2. Delete operations fail with "Access denied" 
3. Data integrity issues

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `middleware/auth.js` file. When a JWT token contained only a `userId` field (not a full user object), the middleware created: `req.user = { userId: decoded.userId }`

When the class creation code tried to extract the instructor ID using:
```javascript
instructorId: (req.user._id || req.user.id || req.user.userId)
```

Since `req.user._id` and `req.user.id` were undefined, it would correctly fall back to `req.user.userId`. However, in some edge cases, the entire `req.user` object was being stringified, resulting in "[object Object]".

## Solution

### 1. Fix the Auth Middleware (COMPLETED)

The `middleware/auth.js` has been updated to ensure `req.user` always has consistent ID fields:

```javascript
// Token only contains userId - create a proper user object
req.user = {
  _id: decoded.userId,
  id: decoded.userId,
  userId: decoded.userId
};
```

This ensures that all three common ID field names are available, preventing any edge cases.

### 2. Fix Existing Data

Run the migration script to fix existing classes:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/mosta/Documents/intellaquiz/intellaclick-cloud-backend
node scripts/fix-instructor-ids-safe.js
```

This script will:
- Find all classes with instructorId = "[object Object]"
- Show you which classes will be fixed
- Ask for confirmation before making changes
- Update the instructorId to the correct user (68acbd4cf1da2cb91f63b8f0)

### 3. Verify the Fix

To verify everything is working:

1. Check that no classes have "[object Object]" as instructorId:
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-instructor-ids.js
```

2. Test creating a new class to ensure it gets the correct instructorId

3. Test deleting a class to ensure access control works properly

## Prevention

The auth middleware fix prevents this issue from happening again by ensuring `req.user` always has a consistent structure regardless of the JWT token format.
